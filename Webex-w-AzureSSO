For integrate Duo MFA with Webex we’ve way

1.	Configure Duo DAG in Webex SSO configuration – In this configuration we’ve to go through 3 actions (Webex Interface + DAG to login Webex + Push Notification) for login into Webex Admin Portal or Meeting
2.	Integrate Webex with Azure – No need to do any configuration from Duo side if Azure AD have already configured with Duo MFA and 

I’ve preferred 2nd option and made documents which is here:

<<< On Webex Admin Portal >>>

•	Navigate to Organization Settings > SSO
•	Turn on SSO Option and You’ll redirect to Activate SSO > Select and export a certificate
•	Select the appropriate Certificate and Click on Download metadata (Most Secure Preferable)


<<< On Azure Admin Portal >>>

•	Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Enterprise applications > New Application > Search Cisco Webex > Create

•	Configuration in Cisco Webex Application in Azure
  > Go to Properties > Visible to users? > Select No
  > Go to User and groups > Assign a User
  >	Go to Single sign-on and Select SAML
  >	Upload the Downloaded Webex metafile
  > Go to Single sign-on > Basic SAML Configuration > Click on Edit button
  >	Copy the Reply URL value and paste it into Sign on URL, and then save your changes.
  >	Go to Single sign-on > SAML Certificate > Federation Metadata XML > Download
  >	Don’t click on Test SSO here

<<< On Webex Admin Portal >>>

Got to Webex Amin Portal and If you’re in certificate selection page in your browser, and then click Next Or go to Management > Organization Settings, scroll to Authentication, and then choose Actions > Import Metadata. 
•	Select More Secure in Certificate signature in metadata (advanced)
•	Select Test SSO setup, and when a new browser tab opens, authenticate with the IdP by signing in.
•	Return to the Control Hub browser tab.
  > If the test was successful, select Successful test. Turn on SSO and click Next.
  > If the test was unsuccessful, select Unsuccessful test. Turn off SSO and click Next.

Note : The SSO configuration does not take effect in your organization unless you choose first radio button and activate SSO.
