We need at least one Azure Active Directory Premium P1 license per tenant for MFA with Conditional Access feature then the feature will start working for now.

if we’ve Office365 Business Premium or Office365 E3 then Azure Active Directory Premium P1 is included already So no need to purchase additional P1 license.

However, in the future if Microsoft will announce/push any update then we’ve to assign License as per user for MFA with Conditional Access feature.

and a side note as we tested now if We select Office 365 Application in Azure Conditional Access then all applications which comes under the office365 menu (Outlook, SharePoint, Team, OneDrive) will be authenticate via DUO MFA.

Here is the final step for configuration.


<<< On Duo Admin Portal >>>

•	Navigate to Application > Protect an Application > Search Microsoft Azure Active Directory > Protect
•	Grant access from Azure Tenant (Use Global Administrator account)
•	Copy the Created JSON file



<<< On Azure Admin Portal >>>

•	Verify Azure Active Directory Premium P1 license in Tenant
•	Search Conditional Access > Custom Control > New custom control > Paste the JSON > Create
•	Navigate Conditional Access > Policies > New Policy > and fill the details as required.
